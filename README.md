# puresheets

## What puresheets does

A spreadsheet editor built on Univer, with cells, formulas, formatting, worksheet tabs, data rules, comments, and charts. Work with editable workbooks and exchange supported spreadsheet formats.

## App layout

| Area | What you use it for |
| --- | --- |
| **Command bar and menus** | Choose editing, formatting, and workbook actions. |
| **Formula bar** | Inspect or edit the value or formula of the selected cell. |
| **Spreadsheet surface** | Select cells, enter data, and work across rows and columns. |
| **Sheet tabs and supporting panels** | Switch worksheets and work with comments, charts, data rules, and agent activity. |

The app also uses the shared [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai) shell and drawer agent. Panels can vary with the current view and selection.

## Getting started

1. Create or open a workbook and enter your own data.
2. Use cells, formulas, formatting, and worksheet tabs to organize the workbook.
3. Save as `.sheets` or portable `.sheets.html`; use the available import/export controls when exchanging files with other spreadsheet tools.

Read the [app guide](docs/app-guide.md) for development, loading, and source-layout details.

## Develop and customize

We welcome **developers and vibecoders alike**. You can add features to puresheets, develop a fork, or create a new app for [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai).

### Use Claude Code, Codex, or your own tools

Open a local source checkout or a purefactory project's folder in your preferred coding tool. Ask it to read this README, `plugin.json`, `package.json`, `agents.md`, and the [development guide](docs/development.md) before making changes. Review the changes, run the app's checks, and test it inside [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai). This source may require matching shared platform packages; a browser preview alone does not provide desktop services.

The [development guide](docs/development.md) explains how to start Claude Code or Codex in the project, work on this repository, and load your app into the desktop.

### Use purefactory inside the desktop

Open **purefactory** (Factory) to describe a new app, or select an available app project and request a feature. Use **Open folder** to continue with external tools and **Open app** to test the result. You can also request a local app change through the app's drawer where app-development integration is available; distinguish changing the app from editing its current document.

Use **Share** in purefactory to create a `.pureapp` package. In current builds, install it through **Settings → System → Install an app → Choose package…**. See the [development guide](docs/development.md#load-and-share-your-app) for the full workflow and version differences.

## Developer accounts and the marketplace

We welcome **developers and vibecoders alike**. Go to [puredesktop.ai](https://puredesktop.ai) and [create a developer account](https://puredesktop.ai/developers) to join the developer community and submit your app for review.

Bring improvements to this app, develop a fork, or build something entirely new. We welcome **open-source and proprietary projects alike** to the [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai) marketplace. Support for **paid apps is coming soon**, so you will be able to charge for your apps if you choose. Forks and redistributed dependencies must follow their applicable licenses.

For developer access, app submissions, or marketplace questions, contact [info@puredesktop.ai](mailto:info@puredesktop.ai).
