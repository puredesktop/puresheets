# puresheets app guide

A spreadsheet editor built on Univer, with cells, formulas, formatting, worksheet tabs, data rules, comments, and charts. Work with editable workbooks and exchange supported spreadsheet formats.

## Workspace layout

| Area | What you use it for |
| --- | --- |
| **Command bar and menus** | Choose editing, formatting, and workbook actions. |
| **Formula bar** | Inspect or edit the value or formula of the selected cell. |
| **Spreadsheet surface** | Select cells, enter data, and work across rows and columns. |
| **Sheet tabs and supporting panels** | Switch worksheets and work with comments, charts, data rules, and agent activity. |

## Working with puresheets

1. Create or open a workbook and enter your own data.
2. Use cells, formulas, formatting, and worksheet tabs to organize the workbook.
3. Save as `.sheets` or portable `.sheets.html`; use the available import/export controls when exchanging files with other spreadsheet tools.

## Development and loading

We welcome **developers and vibecoders alike**. [Create a developer account on puredesktop.ai](https://puredesktop.ai/developers), then use Claude Code, Codex, your own editor, or purefactory to develop this app or create a new one.

The [development guide](development.md) covers preparing this repository's shared dependencies, starting a coding agent, adding features in purefactory, and checking the result in the desktop. It includes the commands available in this repository.

Use **Open folder** in purefactory to edit a project externally, and **Open app** to test it. Use **Share** to create a `.pureapp` package, then **Settings → System → Install an app → Choose package…** in current builds to install it. Older versions may provide **File → Install App…**. A development server URL alone does not install an app.

To extend this app in purefactory, select its editable project when available. Source development builds can expose the suite's own apps; packaged installations do not expose every built-in app's source. See [create or extend an app](development.md#create-or-extend-an-app-with-purefactory) for that distinction and the app drawer workflow.
